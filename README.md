## Project Overview

Project Overview

1) We have created a project about e-commerce. We have pc accessories and components. User can add necessary items to the shopping cart and pay for them. Also, users can authenticate, view all products, search them and add them to their cards, pay for them and see information about delivery. Payment methods are: CreditCard and Kaspi. Also delivery methods: Courier, Post Office delivery. We used a database for storage products of our shop. Also, we did a simple interface in the console for users convenience.

2) Idea of the project was to implement 6 patterns into an e-commerce project. Understand and create a simple program which is going to be the prototype of a computer shop with necessary products, some payments and variation of delivery.

3) Purpose of the project is to combine and make a logical structure of the shop with only important methods which we can see from any shop in the city. Also connect database for storage information and products.

4) The objective of the work: authenticate the user and let him view all products and give him opportunity to add interested products to the shopping cart and give him some variation of payment and delivery methods.

## Features / Design Patterns

1) User Authentication:

- Users can register with a username and password.

5) Observer Pattern:

- The Observer pattern is used to notify users about product updates, such as stock changes and discounts.

## Conclusion

1) Key points: So we did a good project about a pc shop using all 6 patterns that we have learned. Finally, we had a good experience of teamwork and solving the problems. Also we tried to do well-structured code and had good logic to connect every element with each other.

2) As a result, we have a pc store created by using design patterns with interfaces and connected database. Also notification about discounts and last item done by using observer pattern, creating items using factory pattern and etc. If we speak about faced problems, they were about how to connect database and implement all patterns into a project. In the end, we did it!

3) Future improvement. All projects can be improved and our project also can be better. We will increase our database and add fields about users, add new products, add more info about users, etc. Firstly, try to upload a project to server and refix code after some advantages of users.
